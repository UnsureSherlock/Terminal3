Port of e17 Terminology to Tizen OS (Tizen:2.4:Mobile)

Tested in emulator and on Samsung Z3 and Samsung Z1

Important notes:

- Still work in progress and quite early
- On screen keyboard, if dismissed, can be brought up by tapping "Menu" button twice
- The main screen adjusts its size to the device size but does not take into account on screen keyboard. Use "Back" button to hide it if you need the full screen.
- There is a nasty bug that applcation does not minimize at all (home button does not work). Fixing it is my main priority at the moment.
